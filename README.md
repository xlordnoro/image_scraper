December 18, 2023 - v1.0 + v1.1 - Added all the initial files for scraping posts on the site that follow my format. **Added the Zeust variants of the scripts later in the same day.**

December 24, 2023 - v1.2 - Add Image_scraper_J0my_version, Imager_scraper_all.js & mass_add_all.js to the repo which expands the functionality of the original versions by including every selector I could find in use by posts.
