# This repo contains all the necessary files required to scrape cover, button, and donation images from posts using puppeteer (automation software).

December 18, 2023 - v1.0 + v1.1 - Added all the initial files for scraping posts on the site that follow my format. **Added the Zeust variants of the scripts later in the same day.**
